During the recruitment process to one of the new financial startups I have been asked to create short loan form. Based on the amount of money to loan and time period, user should receive basic calculations like monthly rate. I started with quick ideation phase. I didn't want to create typical form with two input fields and sliders even if that was the best UX option. I wanted to try something else. I had two ideas both mostly based on the mobile first approach. First idea was to create two step wizard with vertical slider for whole height of the view and background color and height representing current value. The second idea was to create UI inspired by physical calculator with digits buttons.

I decided to go with the second idea because of the time constraints. I had only some time during the weekend to code it and I didn't want to spend much time on implementing vertical slider. Maybe next time.

Side projects let you play around with new tools, make something in a different way, or just explore your ideas. Besides the learning aspects, it's just fun to build something new.

It doesn't have to be big, it can be even really small like a nice button or well-crafted method. That one small step will help you grow as a professional and make your craft better.

Here is a small side project developed during the weekend. Concept of the loan calculator [https://lnkd.in/evrqex7](https://lnkd.in/evrqex7)

Designed in Figma, build using React & styled-components. You can find source code on Github https://lnkd.in/e-VMtY5
