I thought about this project in 2012 and for 8 years I didn't' find time or motivation to make it real. Last year (2020) I decided to do big changes in my work life. I left the company where I have spent the last 8 years where I learned a lot doing various things. It was time to do the next step, leave my comfort zone, challenge myself in new environments. It was also the perfect time to make this website real.

## What is it?

TheBuild is my notebook where I document how to build digital products in a better way. Starting from software craftsmanship, quality to product and talent management.

I learned a lot during the process of scaling software-house from 5 to more than 100 people, company acquisition, working in distributed teams. Working with customers from different industries, e-commerce, finance, automotive. Changing company strategy from software house focused on mobile and web development to creative technology studio for the automotive industry. I will share what I have already learned. Talk and learn from other people in the industry about their best practices.

## Who am I?

This is my short story. My parents bought me a Commodore64 for my birthday when I was a kid. Together with the computer, I received a book about Basic programing language. At that time I started to code. After the first visit with my father on the semi-legal computer market at the University of Technology I already knew what I want to do in the future. I loved the atmosphere, passion for computers, games, and software. I completed a master's degree in software engineering and focused on web technologies.

In my professional career, I was working in multiple roles. As a Back-end developer, front-end developer, and team leader. In various technologies like Java, Spring, Javascript, React, Ruby on Rails. In different areas of business, product development, quality assurance, talent management, product ownership, marketing, and innovations.
