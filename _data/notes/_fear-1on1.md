I started using 1on1s as one of my basic leadership tools short after starting my first role as a leader. I didn't yet know how to do it. It was a new tools in our compoany so noone had exerience how to properly use it. We didn't had a HR at that time, no help here also. The only help where articles about 1on1 practice available on the web. I remeber clearly two sources that I have used, Spotify's blog and Micheal Loop's blog.
1on1's weren't popular tool, to be honest I still don't know if it is right now. For sure I can say that it is often used in a bad way. I heard mulitple stories from new joiners about weird practicies called 1on1s in different companies. Most of them were surprised or even scaried before thay first 1on1. This year when I finally decided to change my job it also happened to me. I was invited to my first 1on1 after two months of work. I was exited and curious how 1on1s are used in other company. I already prepared list of topics that I would like to discuss, ideas for improvements. Instead of discussion I was surprised with "reprymenda" without possibility to share my point of view. After everything I felt demotivated, unfair treated. The reason for this kind of 1on1 experience was organizational culture, common way of working and communication shared in company. At the same time management couldn't understand often people rotation and why people don't want to join company.
