I started using 1on1s as one of my basic leadership tools short after starting my first role as a leader. At that time our company was growing fast. We quickly grew from 6 people to around 60. Our team was based on the senior consultants who could run projects by themselves or in small experienced teams. Our structure was flat. Just three founders and the rest software consultants. Without HR. Without middle managers.
We introduced a new leadership role to scale people management and develop certain areas of our offering. Every leader was responsible for about 20 people in different roles. We all decided to use 1on1s at that time. To keep track of agreements with team members we decided to document 1on1s. And the way how we document evolved constantly.

<h2>Simple notes</h2>

At my first 1on1s that I made notes on a piece of paper or in the notebook. I didn't want to notes influence the flow of the conversation.

Then after every meeting, I did the following:

- Rewrite my short, handwritten notes to digital form. In our case on the Atlassian Confluence platform.
- We talked in our native language but because we work in a multinational company I have translated everything to English.
- Send final notes to the team member for review. for transparency & review.

Notes had a form of short sentences. It shortly described context, actions, or suggestions. For example "Peter likes the project. He plans to refactor messaging component and organize lightning talk about it."

What I have learned

- Use your native language if you don't need to use English or any other company standard language.
- Writing short sentences or infinitive provide context for the people that were part of the discussion but can be not understood by the people that were not part of the discussion. There might be even a misunderstanding between you and your team member.
- Doing notes after the meeting takes more time than expected. It takes even more time if you don't do it right after the meeting.

<h2>Mindmap</h2>

The other way that we have used to create notes were mindmaps. It engages both sides in the documenting process creatively. You can stand together next to the whiteboard, discuss and do the notes together. It can be digitalized using a simple photo or digital mindmaps. As a previous method, it has one flaw, it might be hard to understand for the people that weren't part of the discussion. To resolve that issue start 1on1 with a short session of discussing previous notes. What changed, what actions you were able to complete.

<h2>Template</h2>

With a growing number of projects, our operations tasks were also growing. We started hiring project managers and introduced a matrix structure. People were assigned to the project teams and at the same time, they were part of the cross projects team focused on the development selected business area. We decided to split 1on1s across projects and technical leaders. Because people had 1on1 with different leaders we had to found a way to track discussions, share insights, and planned actions.

We started to do digital notes during the 1on1s together on a shared monitor. The prepared template helped us to organize notes into different topics:

- Current work status
- Growth discussion
- Feeling
- Feedback about the company, offering
- Feedback from the team and leader
- Short & long term actions

We changed the way how we document discussions. Short, one-line sentences were replaced with more complex notes easier to understand for every leader. We started to ask more about "why" and "how".

We have used the Confluence page properties system to store the last date of 1on1, plan the next date. This helps us track the progress of the meetings, overall feeling inside the company, react to the most repeated topics or issues.
From a privacy perspective access to 1on1 notes has only leaders group and team member. In our newly opened office team decided to keep all the notes transparent so every person in the company can read them.
